# ðŸª„ houdini

The disappearing GraphQL client built for the Svelte community.

## âœ¨ Features

- Composable data requirements at a component level
- Document caching and declarative updates
- Sapper/Sveltekit ready
- Generated types 
- Customizable error handling (coming soon)

At it's core, Houdini seeks to enable a high quality developer experience
without compromising runtime bundle size. Like Svelte, Houdini shifts what is 
traditionally handled by a bloated runtime into a compile step that allows 
for the generation of an incredibly lean GraphQL abstraction for your application.

## âš¡ Example

An example application can be found in the <a href='./example'>example directory</a>
